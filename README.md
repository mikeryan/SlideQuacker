# Wrong Island Con Slide Quacker

The Wrong Island Con Slide Quacker is an electronic conference badge
that's actually useful! You can pair it with your laptop and use it as a
traditional slide clicker, as it implements the HID over GATT profile.

The firmware is an app running on [Apache
Mynewt](http://mynewt.apache.org), an open source RTOS and BLE stack.
The app is heavily based on the bleprph example application.
